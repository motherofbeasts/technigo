  <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
  <p>Pair programming is not just to work in 
    a team of two. You work as one unit with 
    the aim of solving a task. There is two 
    roles in pair programming but both team 
    members has to feel comfortable to take 
    part of both. This is because you alternate 
    between the tasks. One role is to do the 
    actual coding and the other role is to 
    supervise and look for error in the code. 
    The different roles is called driver and 
    observer. There is of course pros and cons 
    to this method but itâ€™s one way to work 
    with coding.</p>
